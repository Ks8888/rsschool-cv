### Task from **Codewars:**

>You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

>However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

-1  =>  false; 0  =>  true; 3  =>  false; 4  =>  true; 25  =>  true; 26  =>  false;

```
function isSquare(n) {
  return Math.sqrt(n) % 1 === 0;
}
